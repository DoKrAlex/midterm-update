        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Alex, and I am a computer science major at the University of Memphis. 
            I have a strong passion for technology and its applications in solving real-world problems. 
            In addition to my studies, I actively participate in the Anime & Gaming Association, 
            where I engage with fellow enthusiasts and explore the latest trends in gaming and anime. 
            Music is also a significant part of my life; I perform with the university band during basketball season, 
            bringing energy and excitement to our games. 
            I created this website to share my projects, interests, and experiences with you. 
            Thank you for visiting!
        </p>
